	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It helps us analyze the efficiency of code. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n) means the execution time grows linearly with input size, while O(1) means it runs in constant time regardless of input. Efficient algorithms aim for lower time complexity to perform faster, especially with large data.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It includes both the temporary space allocated and the input storage. For example, if an algorithm stores input elements in a separate list, it may have a space complexity of O(n), meaning the memory used grows linearly with the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to use as little extra space as possible.</p>
