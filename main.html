	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It includes both the temporary space allocated and the input storage. For example, if an algorithm stores input elements in a separate list, it may have a space complexity of O(n), meaning the memory used grows linearly with the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to use as little extra space as possible.</p>
